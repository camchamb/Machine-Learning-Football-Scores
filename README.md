# Machine-Learning-Football-Scores
Over the course of a semester, I worked on this project with a team of 4. In the end, we obtained a 90% accuracy rate in our test set. Together we wrote a full report detailing our findings. This report can be found in the main branch.

Each group member focused primarily on a different part of the code. I worked on the Decision Tree models, the Forest Regressor, and the final ensemble.
